# ntfy server config file
#
# Public facing base URL of the service (e.g. https://ntfy.sh or https://ntfy.example.com)
#
# This setting is required for any of the following features:
# - attachments (to return a download URL)
# - e-mail sending (for the topic URL in the email footer)
# - iOS push notifications for self-hosted servers (to calculate the Firebase poll_request topic)
# - Matrix Push Gateway (to validate that the pushkey is correct)
#
#base-url:

# Listen address for the HTTP & HTTPS web server. If "listen-https" is set, you must also
# set "key-file" and "cert-file". Format: [<ip>]:<port>, e.g. "1.2.3.4:8080".
#
# To listen on all interfaces, you may omit the IP address, e.g. ":443".
# To disable HTTP, set "listen-http" to "-".
#
listen-http: ":80"
listen-https: ":443"

# Path to the private key & cert file for the HTTPS web server. Not used if "listen-https" is not set.
#
key-file: "/config/keys/private/cert.key"
cert-file: "/config/keys/public/cert.crt"

# If "cache-file" is set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory.
# This allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# The "cache-duration" parameter defines the duration for which messages will be buffered
# before they are deleted. This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
# The cache file is created automatically, provided that the correct permissions are set.
#
cache-file: "/config/cache.db"
cache-duration: "24h"

# If set, access to the ntfy server and API can be controlled on a granular level using
# the 'ntfy user' and 'ntfy access' commands. See the --help pages for details, or check the docs.
#
# - auth-file is the SQLite user/access database; it is created automatically if it doesn't already exist
# - auth-default-access defines the default/fallback access if no access control entry is found; it can be
#   set to "read-write" (default), "read-only", "write-only" or "deny-all".
#
auth-file: "/config/user.db"
auth-default-access: "read-write"

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors are rate limited
#          as if they are one.
#

# If enabled, clients can attach files to notifications as attachments. Minimum settings to enable attachments
# are "attachment-cache-dir" and "base-url".
#
# - attachment-cache-dir is the cache directory for attached files
# - attachment-total-size-limit is the limit of the on-disk attachment cache directory (total size)
# - attachment-file-size-limit is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M)
# - attachment-expiry-duration is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h)
#
attachment-cache-dir: "/config/attachments"
attachment-total-size-limit: "1G"
attachment-file-size-limit: "5M"
attachment-expiry-duration: "24h"

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.
#
keepalive-interval: "45s"

# Defines the root path of the web app, or disables the web app entirely.
#
# Can be any simple path, e.g. "/", "/app", or "/ntfy". For backwards-compatibility reasons,
# the values "app" (maps to "/"), "home" (maps to "/app"), or "disable" (maps to "") to disable
# the web app entirely.

#web-root: "/"
